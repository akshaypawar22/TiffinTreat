                            Our organisation strives to eliminate classroom hunger by implementing the Mid-Day Meal Scheme 
                            in the government schools and government-aided schools.

                            Since 2020, HomeMade has been concerting all its efforts towards providing 
                            fresh and nutritious meals to children on every single school day. 
                            We are continuously leveraging technology to multiply our reach.

                            along with the persistent support from corporates, individual donors, 
                            and well-wishers have helped us to grow from serving just 1,500 children in 5 schools in 2000 
                            to serving 1.8 million children.
